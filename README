# 💫 About Me:
As an Electronics Engineer, I am driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate hardware and software. My journey as a self-taught programmer has led me to specialize in microcontroller programming, where I have honed my skills in working with both 8-bit and 32-bit architectures.<br><br>Through my hands-on experience, I have developed a deep understanding of  circuit design. Each project I share is a testament to my commitment to applying theoretical knowledge into practical applications, often starting from scratch to achieve optimal results.
